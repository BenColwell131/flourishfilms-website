              <h3>Project:</h3>
              <p>Eddie Rockets needed a video marketing solution to showcase a new range of burgers being developed for release in late 2017. They wanted a cost-effective strategy that would heighten awareness of their new range across a short time-scale and would engage as many consumers as possible. The ultimate goal was to translate views into sales.  </p>

              <!-- Paragraph 2: Strategy -->
              <h3>Strategy:</h3>
              <p>The idea was to launch a short series of videos (approx. 10s long) for release on Snapchat. The videos consisted of a concise and impactful structure which perfectly illustrated the new range. The series was maintained from November 2017 through to February of 2018, with a few alterations made at Christmas to adjust the visuals. The series played across the Snapchat ad interface, most notably the web view format. This allowed Eddie Rocket's target demographic to swipe up and quickly access a custom landing page, to view the new range and place an order, all within a matter of seconds. </p>

              <!-- Paragraph 3: Results -->
              <h3>Results:</h3>
              <p>The strategy was a resounding success. Eddie Rockets saw an increase in web traffic from 30,000 to over 1 million and a simultaneous 14% increase in sales all within the first month. </p>

              <p>Offbeat required a release strategy to showcase a mixture of their current range of donuts as well as some new additions. The content had to be punchy, concise and appropriate for presentation on digital billboards in multiple shopping centers across Dublin. The series was in anticipation of the opening of a new store in Tallaght. It was to be showcased throughout the center, on in-store TVs and on a cinema screen located within the center. </p>

              <p>The idea was to showcase the essence of each donut, capturing their unique character, the feelings they evoke and the senses they engage. The Flourish team developed an efficient production method which consisted of building a miniature set which they could design differently depending on the identity of each donut. The videos were playful and energetic, creatively utilising space, set design, toppings and fillings to illustrate Offbeat's fun-loving and passionate approach to the confectionery market, with an emphasis on the care, skill and thought put into developing their industry-shaping product. </p>

              <h3>Project:</h3>
              <p>Camile approached Flourish with a view to securing some content to showcase their menu across Ireland and the UK. The challenge was to produce content that not only demonstrated the superior quality of the food, but also hinted at the effortless incorporation of Camile into your dinner/evening plans. Additionally, the content had to be in keeping with Camile’s firmly established aesthetic, something the Flourish team had to emulate and hone for video release. </p>

              <h3>Strategy:</h3>
              <p>The series consists of two core components: a food showcase and lifestyle highlights. The first segment was produced on location in a Camile restaurant and was filmed using a dual camera setup positioned around a set that could be adjusted depending on the product. The second segment consisted of developing some short scenes with actors, intended to appeal to Camile's young, urban demographic, for whom eating Camile is a staple lifestyle component. The videos were released on YouTube, Facebook and Instagram across Ireland and the UK, with strategic releases for special dates. </p>

              <!-- Paragraph 3: Results -->
              <h3>Results:</h3>
              <p>Strategic releases of certain videos garnered huge viewership and translated into significant sales increases. For instance, Camile were able to pay for the entire advert campaign from the sales increases generated by one video, a couples' movie night clip, which was strategically released before Valentine's Day. </p>

              <p>Anthony Walsh from A1 Coaching approached Flourish about the prospect of putting together a series of videos for release on YouTube to bolster membership of his cycling consultancy service, A1 Coaching.  Anthony had a very clear vision. He wanted videos that were punchy, entertaining, informative and that didn't take themselves too seriously. He wanted to share his expertise with the world and get viewers engaged on a regular basis. </p>

              <!-- Paragraph 2: Strategy -->
              <h3>Strategy:</h3>
              <p>The plan was to launch a standalone, flagship video, entitled 'Consistency,' which would represent Anthony's ethos for successful training. This video was then followed by a series of short videos in a chat show format that featured him and various guests who would offer insight into the nuances of professional cycling. </p>

              <!-- Paragraph 2: Strategy -->
              <h3>Strategy:</h3>

The team also put together a web series for domestic release on Facebook that would consist of several short clips outlining and instructing on a specific rugby skill, offering insight on the best techniques and illustrating the care and attention that goes into IRI training services. </p>

              <!-- Paragraph 1: Project overview -->
              <h3>Project:</h3>
              <p>Offbeat were a relatively young company when this first idea came to fruition. They wanted something that would register with consumers and make their brand something to talk about. Operating within an intensely competitive market in Dublin, the Offbeat team wanted to stand out and create a consistent strategy for continuous content that would solidify their identity. </p>

              <!-- Paragraph 2: Strategy -->
              <h3>Strategy:</h3>
              <p>The idea evolved out of a service that Offbeat were offering, catering to corporate clients and events. The project lasted about a week and was one of the first large-scale productions for which the Flourish team have been responsible. The idea was to inject Offbeat energy, joy, passion and flavour into the archetypes of mundane situations. The comic element of this video (and the later series that developed out of it) was designed to act as a contrast to other marketing approaches within the industry and to engage consumers in a novel way. The video was released in tandem with a competition which encouraged viewers to tag their office heroes with a chance of winning donuts for their department. Each part of the production was catered to by the Flourish team; from procuring an original soundtrack to sourcing locations, actors, set components and editing/colour grading. </p>

              <!-- Paragraph 3: Results -->
              <h3>Results:</h3>
              <p>The notion of the office hero began as a lightly satirical comment on office life and has since turned into a video marketing strategy capable of spanning demographics and endlessly evolving. The video received an aggregate 50 thousand views and 400 shares on its Facebook release, with the competition element of the release bolstering its shareability. Offbeat received an overwhelmingly positive response to the video and huge participation in the competition. It generated a lot of engagement with the company and solidified their position, not only as the leading donut company in Dublin, but as a fun, recognisable and strong brand. </p>

              <h3>Project:</h3>
              <p>The success of the 'Be The Office Hero' video spurred Offbeat on to demand a series of videos along a similar theme. They wanted to further compound their brand but cater to a new demographic and adapt the message to cover, not only new scenarios, but different times of year. The video is the first installment of a three-part Facebook series.</p>

              <!-- Paragraph 2: Strategy -->
              <h3>Strategy:</h3>
              <p>The idea flows from the same motif established in 'Be The Office Hero.' A character saves the day by entering dramatically, brandishing Offbeat donuts. The production took the bulk of a week from start to finish and was released in early December to catch the Christmas wave. Each part of the production was catered to by the Flourish team; from procuring music to sourcing locations, actors, set components and editing/colour grading. </p>

              <!-- Paragraph 3: Results -->
              <h3>Results:</h3>
              <p>The video received an aggregate 93 thousand views, almost twice the number of views garnered by the first Offbeat video without any other changes. People were eagerly awaiting it's release and this sparked natural growth. </p>

              <h3>Project:</h3>
              <p>The Flourish team were fortunate enough to be invited to provide video services for RTÉ and the Screen Directors' Guild of Ireland. The two groups were involved in producing a four-part web series for release on the RTÉ Culture website which would offer a snapshot into life in the Irish Film and TV industry. </p>

              <!-- Paragraph 2: Strategy -->
              <h3>Strategy:</h3>
              <p>The content was filmed live, with four of Ireland's top TV and Film directors offering their unique perspectives on the challenges faced by Irish directors, the idiosyncrasies of the industry and prospects for Irish film. The footage was compiled into four web videos, each approximately 45 minutes in length available on the RTÉ Culture website. </p>

              <h3>Project:</h3>
              <p>This was a unique project which started as a commercial production but ended up being a passion project for the Flourish team and something that could be used to showcase the narrative-intense side of the team's work. </p>

              <!-- Paragraph 2: Strategy -->
              <h3>Strategy:</h3>
              <p>The project was produced by the Flourish team from start to finish, filmed on location over the course of a day and incorporated professional actors and composers. The project gave the team the rare opportunity to take full creative license and explore and resource an idea from a non-marketing perspective. In hindsight, the short film could likely double as an effective campaign for a paintball company if a proper release strategy was put in place. </p>
